\section{Introduction}
\par When writing code, we might use repeating code, or sometimes we want to keep the code organized by splicing a big chunk of code into many small parts. Using \texttt{modules} would finish this perfectly
\section{Easy example}
For instance, this is a module: 
\begin{python}
	def hello(name):
		print("hello"+name)
\end{python}
It seems like a function, right? However, a module includes \textbf{more than functions, since it can include class object, or even modules too.}
\section{How to import a module?}
After reading the function chapter (chapter 3), you will understand functions and therefore might know to write some modules at once, but you might ask :"how could I import them?"

Well the answer is
\begin{enumerate}
	\item save the file as hellom.py
	\item In another file add "import hello"
	\item now call the \textbf{function} ! You can call it by using hellom.hello("Tom")
\end{enumerate}<++>
		You might ask "Why do we have to name the file such a random name?" This is because of two reasons
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item If you just name the file as simple "hello", it might have the same name as the module you installed (like since it has a actually common package called "common", naming a package "random" would definitely cause error, and therefore you should be careful about the naming convention.)
			\item Naming the file "hello-module" doesn't work since the compiler won't identify it (it is not a identifier), while naming it as "hellom.py" or "hello\_m.py" is allowed
		\end{enumerate}
\section{Tricks in using modules}
\subsection{Renaming the modules}
Imagining one day you are just too lazy to import the module, or the module's name is too long (like matploblib.pyplot), you could try
\begin{python}
	import  matplotlib.pyplot as plt
\end{python}
and now whenever you want to use the module 'matplotlib.pyplot', you can write it as 'plt'
\subsection{Importing part of the module}
When you only want to import a little bit of function from a bloated module, just use
\begin{python}
	from hellom.py import hello
\end{python}
and now you only have one function left!
